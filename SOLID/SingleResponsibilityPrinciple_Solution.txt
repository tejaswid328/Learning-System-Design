Single Responsibilty Principle

This states that Class should have one reason to change which means every class
should have a single responsibility or single job or single purpose.

Solution:
Create New classes for printing Invoice and saveToDB

Class Marker{
	String name,color;
	int year,price;

	pulic Marker(String name,String color,int year,int price)
	{
		this.name=name;
		this.color=colr;
		this.year=year;
		this.price=price;
	}
}

Class Invoice{
	Private Marker marker;
	Private int quantity;

	Public Invoice(Marker marker,int quantity)
	{
		this.marker=marker;
		this.quantity=quantity;
	}

	Public int CalculateTotal(){
		int price=(marker.price*this.quantity);
		return price;
	}
}

Class InvoiceDao{
	Invoice invoice;
	public InvoiceDao(Invoice invoice)
	{
		this.invoice=invoice;
	}
	public void saveToDB()
	{
		//Save to DB
	} 
}

Class InvoicePrinter{
	private Invoice invoice;
	
	public InvoicePrinter(Invoice invoice)
	{
		this.invoice=invoice;
	}
	public void printInvoice()
	{
		//print the invoice
	}
}
